Hello and welcome to dev challenge.

Build a simple To Do application with,
- a textbox where you can input todo item text.
- list of todo items with checkboxes
- clicking on checkbox will mark item as done. 
- optional: you may move done item to a different list

on writing code
- Use an API to fetch/update data 
- todo items should persist on page reload. Feel free to use any caching method server side.

Project scaffolding is provided in the zip.
There are two prerequisites (ignore if you have it installed),
- Visual Studio 2019 or Visual Studio 2022 (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)
- .NET Framework 4.7.2 developer pack (https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net472)
- Make sure you can build and run project before adding new code.

Open solution by double clicking FusionWebDev_ToDoApp.sln
You should see ASP.NET MVC project being loaded with
    - Controllers > HomeController.cs
    - API > ToDoController.cs
    - Scripts > ToDoApp.js 
    - Views > Home > Index.cshtml
    - and other required files included
    
 
Use Index.cshtml to write UI
Use ToDoApp.js for javascript code. You can use JQuery if you prefer (Package is already included).
Use ToDoController.cs for server side code and caching data.

You can be creative with your solution and feel free to change things around.
Bonus points,
1) App meets accessibility standards and able to demonstrate how you achieved it.
2) Use Bootstrap framework to stylize your app.
